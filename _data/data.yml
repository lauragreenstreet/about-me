career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: "I am interested in problems in artificial intelligence and optimization that arise from other disciplines of science. I am particularly passionate about problems with social and enviromental impact and am excited to working with Dr. Carla Gomes on problems in computational sustainability. These projects are often data-intensive and I enjoy working with large datasets from cleaning to visualization to better understand the problem. My previous research projects include mapping connectivity of protected areas at a global scale, mapping and identifing gaps in electric vehicle infrastructure, and using optimization to understand cellular development trajectories."
