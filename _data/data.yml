    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am a second-year masters student transitioning into the PhD program in Cornell’s Department of Computer Science.
      I work with Dr. Carla Gomes to develop AI and optimization methods with sustainability applications. Previously,
      I worked with Dr. Claire Kremen to scale an analysis of functional connectivity to the global level and with
      Dr. Geoffrey Schiebinger to develop optimization methods for single-cell genomics.

      - title: Modelling Connectivity of Global Protected Areas
        tagline: |
            Large mammals often require more space than a single protected area and having connected protected areas
            is key for gene dispersal. It is important to understand which protected areas are isolated or at risk of
            isolation. I worked with Dr. Claire Kremen on the first global study of
            resistance-based connectivity, which takes into account the many possible paths across a landscape. Our
            results identified areas that are critical for connectivity but remain unprotected and we compared
            the overlap of these areas with existing conservation prioritization schemes.
      - title: Spatial and Temporal Single-cell Transcriptomics
        tagline: |
                  Single-cell RNA-sequencing has allowed researchers to get snapshots of gene expression in individual cells.
                  However, as the sequencing process is destructive and disassociates cells within a tissue, there is a need
                  for methods to understand how development occurs in both space in time. I worked with Dr. Geoffrey Schiebinger
                  on projects applying optimal transport to understand developmental trajectories and helped develop GPS-Seq,
                  a manifold-learning approach to spatial transcriptomics that allows cellular positions to be reconstructed
                  without the use of imaging.
