    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am interested in artificial intelligence and optimization and am particularly passionate about problems with social and
      environmental impact. I am currently a graduate student in Computer Science at Cornell working with Dr. Carla Gomes on
      problems in computational sustainability. My projects are often data-intensive, incorporating data visualization and analysis.

      - title: Modelling Connectivity of Global Protected Areas
        tagline: |
            Large mammals often require more space than a single protected area and having connected protected areas
            is key for gene dispersal. It is important to understand which protected areas are isolated or at risk of
            isolation. I worked with Dr. Claire Kremen on the first global study of
            resistance-based connectivity, which takes into account the many possible paths across a landscape. Our
            results identified areas that are critical for connectivity but remain unprotected and we compared
            the overlap of these areas with existing conservation prioritization schemes.
      - title: Spatial and Temporal Single-cell Transcriptomics
        tagline: |
                  Single-cell RNA-sequencing has allowed researchers to get snapshots of gene expression in individual cells.
                  However, as the sequencing process is destructive and disassociates cells within a tissue, there is a need
                  for methods to understand how development occurs in both space in time. I worked with Dr. Geoffrey Schiebinger
                  on projects applying optimal transport to understand developmental trajectories and helped develop GPS-Seq,
                  a manifold-learning approach to spatial transcriptomics that allows cellular positions to be reconstructed
                  without the use of imaging.
      - title: Mapping and Identifying Gaps in Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
        tagline: |
            Through the UBC Data Science Institute's Data Science for Social Good Program, I worked with the City of Surrey
            towards reaching 100% electric vehicles in the city by 2050. I helped map existing infrastructure
            and developed the database for an app that lets city planners explore electric vehicle infrastructure and
            socio-economic data. I also worked on a model for placing EV chargers that used traffic and census data to provide
            equal access to residents across the city based on their driving patterns. The full project report is available
            <a href="https://dsi.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/dssg-finalreport-surrey-ev.pdf">here</a>.
